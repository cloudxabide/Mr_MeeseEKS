I connect with very few "pop culture" things these days.  Mostly because I am old... and busy... grumpy... (I digress).  But, I do enjoy some Rick and Morty.  More enjoyable that Mr Meeseeks literally has EKS in his name.  So... here we are.

[Ooooohh Yaaaaa!   Cannnn dooo!](https://youtu.be/mW-JmtGfW_A?t=31)  Nailed it.

[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) handles a *SIGNIFICANT* amount of "undiferentiated heavy lifting".  

Examples of Amazon EKS advantages:  
* Installation of Kubernetes
* Operation and Maintenance of the Kubernetes cluster
* Management of the Kubernetes control-plane

Additionally, you still can leverage the growing number of tools, approaches, etc.. that the Kubernetes community has to offer (like Karpenter, which we'll be checking out).

## Prerequisites and considerations

* Active AWS account with adequate permissions to perform the actions in this script (sorry for being vague here - I don't have a succinct list of privs for this activity at this time)

While I use [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) that is not a necessity.  (I do recommend you check it out though, if you've not used it).
